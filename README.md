Personal usage, you can take the idea from it in order to develop the bot to work with all categories and more posts.
I've made it in order to bounce my one specific ad automatically.

HOW TO USE:
*You may need to download your own chromedrive from google that matches your chrome version.
'python main.py email password'
In LINUX, launch the command in crontab.
In WINDOWNS, Put the file under Task Scheduler.
* Reminder: Ads can bounce once in every 4 hours *
